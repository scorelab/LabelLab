LabelLab is an image analysis and classification platform for Machine Learning researchers. Originally built to classify images of elephants, it has been developed over the years and is now a full-fledged ML utility tool that is able to classify all kinds of images and carry out a number of ML-related tasks in a project-based manner while teaming up with other researchers.

## Features

- The user can create a project and add other users as collaborators.
- Inside a project, multiple actions can be performed such as -
  - Uploading images in batches
  - Creating new labels
  - Labelling the uploaded images
  - Creating and training different kinds of models
  - Using the image path tracking feature on labeled images
- Each collaborator can be assigned one or more roles such as images, labels, models, admin, etc which will allow that collaborator to perform tasks specific to that role.
- On basis of their roles, the collaborators are divided into various teams.
- Each team has a chat system to discuss the assigned tasks and progress on the project.
- The project also has an activity tracking system recording all progress in it, which can be filtered by team, project member, category, and entity.
- Besides that, the user can also upload images outside a project and run classifications against a trained model.
